# Pong Game

### By Sean O'Connor, Fall 2023 (CSCI 201)

### Project Summary:
This is a simple implementation of a pong game written using the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. The game is single player, where the player controls a paddle and tries to hit the ball past the computer's paddle. The game ends when one player scores 10 points.

It can be played [here](https://soconnor0919.github.io/pong-game/).

### Challenges Faced:
While creating this program, I had some to learn how to use the p5.js framework, as well as figure out how to implement the game logic. I also had to become comfortable with the p5.js library to draw the game objects to the screen, which took some time. Other than the initial learning curve, the framework was easy to pick up, as I had prior experience using JavaScript and working with web-based applications in general.

### Resources Used:
