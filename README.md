## By Sean O'Connor, Fall 2023 (CSCI 201)

### Project Summary:
This is a simple implementation of a pong game written using the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. The game is single player, where the player controls a paddle and tries to hit the ball past the computer's paddle. The game ends when one player scores 10 points.
